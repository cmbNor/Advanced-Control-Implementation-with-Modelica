# Advanced Control Implementation with Modelica

This repository contains the code and resources for my master's thesis in industrial IT and automation at the University of South East Norway, focusing on advanced control implementations in the field of Modelica. The work presented here includes both OpenModelica and Python code developed to study and implement innovative control strategies.

## Introduction

The objective was to explore possibilities for linking a Modelica model to external control strategies, either through using Modelica external objects or utilizing Functional Mock-up Units (FMUs), and conducting simulations in Python.

## Repository Structure

- `/MPC/`: Contains Modelica source code organized in a package.
- `/PythonSourceCode/AirHeaterFMUEvaluation/`: Contains Python code for evaluating the performance/validation of Air Heater FMUs.
- `/PythonSourceCode/AirHeaterFMUwithPID/`: Contains a Python implementation of a PI controller using an FMU of an air heater.
- `/PythonSourceCode/AirHeaterFMUwithMPC/`: Contains a Python implementation of an MPC controller using an FMU of an air heater.
- `/PythonSourceCode/AirHeaterModelEvaluation/`: Contains a Python implementation where four different FMUs are imported and evaluated for performance and accuracy.
- `/PythonSourceCode/AirHeaterStateSpace/`: Contains a Python implementation where different state-space models are built based on a Laplace model of the air heater.
- `/PythonSourceCode/OptimizationScripts/`: Contains a Python implementation to generate plots for the report, illustrating optimization in Python as a reference to source code implemented in C.
